# The Shape of Development {#shape}

Establishing the optimal shape of development.

```{r read data 03, eval=F}
#single.cohort = read.csv(paste0(datadir,'02-single-cohort.csv'))

#multiple.cohort = read.csv(paste0(datadir,'01-abcd.csv'))

#accelerated = read.csv(paste0(datadir,'02-accelerated.csv'))
```

## Polynomial Trajectories
*Show intercept-only, linear, quadratic, and inverse trajectories for MLM/LCM/LCSM (to a point)'*

## Piecewise Trajectories
*Show linear/linear and linear/quadratic trajectories for MLM & LCM, cubic splines with GAMM?'*
*Show both 2-rate and added-rate*

## Nonlinear Trajectories
*MLM: show negatively accelerated exponential*
*GAMM: full GAMM with b-splines*
*LCM: Show 2 free-loading forms*
*LCSM: dual-change model*


## Additional Considerations

### Fixed and Random Effects
*show in accelerated (braintime) data that we can estimate a quadratic overall trend even though no one has 4 observations*

### Generalizability
*Code for cross-validiation?*
