# Covariates and Distal Outcomes {#covariates}

Including covariates and distal outcomes into our models.

```{r read data covariates, eval=F}
```

## Covariates
### Time Invariant Covariates
*Show with MLM/GAMM/LCM*
*Need to check if TICs are possible with LCSMs (something Patrick said makes me think no)*
*latent TIC?*
*joint likelihood*

### Time Varying Covariates
*Show with MLM/GAMM/LCM*
*LCM: show unique time-specific relationships*
*show fixed vs random effects*
*show contemporaneous and lagged effects*

### Cross-level Interactions
*Show with MLM and LCM*

### Within- and Betwen-Person Variance
*show approaches to centering in the MLM*
*show RI-CLPM/LCM-SR model*

### Multivariate Models
*Show with MLM/LCM/LCSM*

## Distal Outcomes
*MLM: show 2 step model*
*LCM: show simultaneous model and 2 step model*
